# AI_Assistant
I created an assistant that listens for commands and performs the tasks appropriately 

The program utilizes libraries such as 
    speech_recognition 
    datetime
    subprocess
    pywhatkit
    pyttsx3
    webbrowser
    
Contains two files main.py which is the base program and AI_Assisntant2.0.py with a few more niche features
